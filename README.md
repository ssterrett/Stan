# Stan Models
These are .stan files of heirarchical models. [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) is a powerful and intuitive statistical platform. I interface with it through R for Bayesian inference with behavioral data. I find [ShinyStan](http://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/shinystan) to be a particularly useful tool for analysis.
